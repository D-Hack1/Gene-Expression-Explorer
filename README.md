🧬 Gene Expression Explorer
🔍 Overview
Gene Expression Explorer is a Streamlit-based interactive web application designed to:

🔬 Predict disease risk using synthetic gene expression data and a trained machine learning model.

🧠 Visualize gene expression compared to healthy individuals.

🧬 Fetch gene information directly from NCBI using gene symbols.

📊 Explore disease-specific gene expression profiles.

This app is built as a hackathon project to demonstrate practical applications of bioinformatics and machine learning in genomics.

🚀 Features
🧪 Disease Risk Prediction
Input gene expression values:

Full gene set (20 synthetic genes)

Selective gene input

Upload CSV files for batch prediction

Predict risk using a trained classifier

Visual comparison of input gene expression with healthy average

Probability distribution over predicted disease classes

🔍 Gene Symbol Lookup
Search a gene symbol and retrieve its description from NCBI Entrez

Includes fallback to synthetic descriptions for demo genes

🧬 Disease-wise Gene Profile
Select a disease to:

View mean expression of all genes for that disease

Compare with healthy gene expression profile (NEWLY ADDED)

📈 Interactive Visualizations
Plotly-based charts for:

Class probabilities

Expression comparison

Disease-specific gene profiles
